The Restaurant Ordering System is a Python-based program that lets customers place orders from a menu. It handles case-insensitive inputs, allows multiple orders, calculates the total bill, and offers a payment choice. With a user-friendly interface, it’s a great beginner project for cafés or learning Python basics.
